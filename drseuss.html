        <h2>Part one: chatgpt's version in the style of Shakespeare</h2>

        <p>In a land so far, where the forests grew tall,
            A young woman named Lilly had a misstep, a great fall.
            Lost in the woods, she wandered astray,
            Unaware that she was where soldiers play.
            
            Suddenly, before her, a soldier in green,
            Held her at gunpoint, oh, what a scene!
            "Who goes there?!" he cried, with eyes full of might,
            Lilly trembled and stammered, "I got lost in the night!"
            But the soldier was stern, his voice didn't sway,
            He said, "You're in a restricted zone, you mustn't stay!"
            Though frightened and teary, she managed to plea,
            And the soldier relented, setting her free.
            
            So remember this tale, with a lesson so true,
            Always beware where your footsteps may spew.
            For a misstep in the woods, though a simple mistake,
            Might lead you to trespass where soldiers await.</p>
