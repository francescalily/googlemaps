    <h1>Why not to use google maps</h1>
    <p>
         On this site you will experience different versions of a gripping tale (not made using chat gpt ofcourse) about a 
         woman who was unfortunate enough, to tresspass on Croatian military grounds. How she was brave 
         enough to stand up for justice at the cost of almost losing her life.
